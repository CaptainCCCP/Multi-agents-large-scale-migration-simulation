# Multi-agents large scale migration simulation

### Final deliverable of Urban Cup in the 3rd International Conference of Urban Science and Intelligence
After achieving 2nd place in the preliminary round with the topic of modeling human mobility during climate disasters like hurricanes, our team advanced to the finals and took on a real-world challenge in large-scale migration modeling: the lack of identical individual tracking data in public datasets.
Our solution was to design a long-term, large-scale agent system that not only captures general migration patterns but also generates identical migration trajectories and reasons for moving. We combined local LLMs (Qwen-3 32B), reinforcement learning methods, and real-world data to make this possible.
